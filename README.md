# gui-pizza-shop
This project contains a simple GUI for a pizza shop built in Java that allows the user to select from one of two pizza sizes and up to four toppings using various java components. The user is then able to select the "Purchase" button located at the bottom of the GUI to calculate what the total price of the pizza will be given their selections.
