# gui-pizza-shop
This program contains a simple GUI for a pizza shop that was created in the Eclipse IDE. The program allows the user to select from one of two pizza sizes and up to four toppings using various java components. The user is then able to select the "Purchase" button on the GUI to calculate what the total price of the pizza will be given their selection. Prices are arbitrarily chosen numbers that have been hard coded in.
